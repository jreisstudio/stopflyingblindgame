# Stop Flying blind game.

A card game to board Understand and visualize the Flight Levels Thinking Model in Action.

## Game Rules
*  Feel free to use the Stop Flying Blind Cards the way you want. The main purpose of it, is to support people on understanding and design  Good Flight Level Architectures.
* Each card deck is designed to support a discussion between 3-4 people around a fake or real cenario to apply the Flight Levels thinking model. If you have a larger group, Split them into smaller one and use more decks.

### Knowledge Setup : 
1. Ask  the group(s) to read the *A* card with the explanation about [Flight Mode] Explanation ( Understand the context, Build Fl. Arch, Define Flight Items and Flight Routes, and define Agile Interactions)
2. Give them 5 minutes  to discuss and build knowledge around these concepts.
3. Explain in 2 minutes what are the items of the Flight Mode (just to ensure everybody got the concept properly)

4. Ask the group(s) to read the *B* card about Flight Level **Activites** (Visualize, Situation, Create Focus, Stabilish Interactions, Measure the progress) and **Levels** (Execution/Operation, Coordination, Strategic).
5. Give them 5 minutes  to discuss and build knowledge around these concepts.
6. Explain in 2 minutes what are the items of the Flight Mode ( just to ensure everybody got the concept properly)


### Playing Seriously!  : 

* Give a context to the group. It can be a real or fake context, depending on the purpose you are playing for.
  * if you are playing just for a teaching purpose invest time in preparing a good context as in an RPG game!  if not,  do a good research job beforehand to support people in understanding the real-world scenario.
  
* Ask  the group(s)  to draw in a flip chart or A3 sheet, the 3 Flight Levels and a first draft of the model they guess could fit the given context.

* Distribute the cards and ask  the participants to read them and select 2 that they think could helpa refactoring of the model they sketchy before. The card can be a tip or trap they must be aware of.

* Each participant must read the cards to the others and explain what comes to his/her mind while reading and how they can change or adapt the sketchy model based on that. The group can accept :thumbs_up: or reject :thumbs_down: the idea (no discussion yet), but every played card must stay visible until the end of the game somewhere in the table.

* After the last participant show the cards, the group have 5 minutes to discuss and refactoring the model based on the accepted cards.

* Repeat it twice more to complete 3 rounds of refactoring.

* If you have more than 1 group  ask them to share what they build in each group and give to the entire group a final round of refactoring based on what they saw in the others model.
