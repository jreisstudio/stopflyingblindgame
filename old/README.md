# Stop Flying blind game.

A card game to board Understand and visualize the Flight Levels Thinking Model in Action.

## Game Rules
1. Ask the group(s) to read the THEORETICAL CARDS  and have some discussion around that. Try to form mixed groups (people that already have some knowledge about FL together with the ones that have no freaking clue about it) to have a better discussion.

2. Read the cards in loud voice explaining and giving context just to ensure that everyone got the point (3 levels, 4 activities, and the flight mode) 

3. Introduce a scenario (fake or real) challenging the group(s) to sketch the very first version of a Flight Levels System Architecture for the given context ( Flight Items, Flight Routes, Agile Interactions,etcâ€¦.)

4. Ask the group(s) to turn the "ARCH. SAMPLE" cards and compare them with the sketched Flight Levels Architecture. Challenge the group(s) to try to improve their proposed model with the insights they got from those cards. That's round 1.

5. Split the "TIPS AND TRAPS" cards to the group participants (2-3 for each one) and ask them to read the card and debrief about it for a while trying to find some interesting improvements to their sketched model. All cards must be read. That's round 2.

6. If you have more than 1 group in the room ask them to present the sketched model to the others that will take note about what's being shared and will debrief a little bit more upon their very own sketched model. That's round 3.

7. Finalize the dynamic with this important awareness:   " Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." - George E.P. Box


## Cards

### THEORETICAL CARDS
Cards that represent  the theory behind the Flight Levels. They must be read and discussed before anything else, so everybody has the same understanding about what Flight Levels mean.

### ARCH SAMPLE CARDS
Learning by Example! With those cards we can see some Architecture samples and have ideas to sketch our model. There isn't a right model, but we can learn a lot by visualizing a lot of "wrong ones" 

### TIPS AND TRAPS
Tips and traps is a collection of learnings we are acquiring during our  Flight Levels Journey.
